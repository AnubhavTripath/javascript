    //  and we can add className in it by directly .className , because in nodeList we already saw that each element have all their properties which is not visible in our end because we have not set that propert

    
    // adding classname
    div.className = "createdByJs"
    div.id = "myId"
    //div.innerHTML = "<h1>Created by javascript</h1>" // this also takes first the reference and then overwrite it
    div.setAttribute("tittle" , "generated title") // for setting the attribute we have to pass the key and value , with this we can set even the id and class
    div.style.backgroundColor = "crimson"

    // by doing the (div.id = "myId") it first takes it value of the id and then overwrite it , but by using the .setAttribute() it directly sets the attributes

    //good way to add the text inside the div is this
    const addtext = document.createTextNode("adding by js throught append");

    div.appendChild(addtext);

    // to attact this div in html
