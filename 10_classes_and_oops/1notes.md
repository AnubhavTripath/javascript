# does javascript have classes ?

# javascript and classes

<!-- is javascript is having classes , technically it doesn't have any classes -->

<!-- after ES6 classes is introduced but it is only for syntactic sugar over exisiting prototype-based inheritance mechanism , in other words it provides more familiar sytax for developer which are coming from the class based languages such as C++ , java -->

## OOPs


## Objects
- collection of properties and methods , properties means those variable and methods means functions . 
<!-- const user = {
  name: "Anubhav",        // property
  age: 25,                // property
  greet: function () {    // method
    console.log("Hello!");
  }
}; -->

-toLowerCase is a property

## why we use OOP
- for the concept of spegedy code , for the proper structure and avoiding the messy code and unable to understand later

## part of OOp
-contructor function
- prototype
- classes
- Instances (new , this)

# 4 pillars
Abstraction -- hides the internal details eg fetch() hides the network call
Encapsulation -- wrap up the data 
Inheritance -- 
Polymorphism  -- one methods do many work eg console log
